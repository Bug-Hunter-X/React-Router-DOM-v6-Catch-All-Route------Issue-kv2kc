This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using catch-all routes ('/*') in React Router DOM v6.  The problem is that the catch-all route doesn't seem to be catching routes that don't explicitly match other routes defined in the Routes component. This often results in unexpected redirects to the home route.

The solution shows how to correctly implement a catch-all route in React Router DOM v6 to handle 404 scenarios effectively.
